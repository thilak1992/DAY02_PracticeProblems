# DAY02_PracticeProblems

If Else Statement Problems
1. Read a single Digit Number and write in word
2. Read a Number 1,10,100,1000 and display unit, ten hundred

Programs With While Loop
1. Write a Program for the sum of n natural numbers eg. Input N=5 output 1+2+3+4+5
2. Write a Program to reverse the integer number eg. Input n=231 reverse is 132

Programs With For Loop
1. Write a Program for the sum of n natural numbers eg. Input N=5 output 1+2+3+4+5
2. Write a Program to reverse the integer number eg. Input n=231 reverse is 132
3. Write a Program to find Palindrome Number
eg. Input n=121 then after reverse output is same 121 then it is a palindrome.
eg. Input n=321 then after reverse output is not same it's 123 then it is not a palindrome number.

Programs with Switch Statement
1. Write a Program to Check Vowel or Consonant
2. Write a Program to print the month name for the given number

Operator Programs
1. Enter two numbers and do the following arithmetic Operations find max and min.
i) a+b*c ii) c+a/b
iii) a%b+c iV) a*b+c
2. Write a program SpringSeason.java that takes two int values m and d from the command line and prints true if day d of month m is between March 20 (m = 3, d=20) and June 20 (m = 6, d = 20), false otherwise.
3. Write a program Quadratic.java to find the roots of the equation a*x*x + b*x + c.
Since the equation is x*x, hence there are 2 roots. The 2 roots of the equation can be found using a formula delta = b*b - 4*a*c
Root 1 of x = (-b + sqrt(delta))/(2*a)
Root 2 of x = (-b - sqrt(delta))/(2*a)
Take a, b, and c as input values to find the roots of x.
4. Write a program Distance.java that takes two integer command-line arguments x and y and prints the Euclidean distance from the point (x, y) to the origin (0, 0). The formulae to calculate distance = sqrt(x*x + y*y). Use Math.power function
